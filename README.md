A simple, dark and compact theme for Threema Web.

## Customization

This theme can be customized very easily. You can set a base color from which most other colors will be calculated, a text color and some accents. Also, you can choose another background for the chat and set its opacity.

By default, it looks like this:

But if you like it even darker, want other accent colors and no background image, you can also make it look like this:

Or, if you prefer it a little lighter:

And of course, you can go totally bananas as well:
